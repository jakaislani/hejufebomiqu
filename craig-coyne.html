Many of their well-wishers were taken aback when they learned of their nuptials. It was almost as though it happened out of nowhere.

Bush, to attend and bless their wedding. Her grandmother died six months ago, on April 17, 2018, at the age of 92. Her grandfather’s health has been deteriorating for several years as well. Because Barbara was concerned that her grandfather would be unable to attend their wedding, the Craig-Barabara decided to tie the knot on their own. As a result, the couple hastened their wedding far earlier than expected.</p><p>Her granddad was able to attend the wedding and be directly by Barbara’s side. Maine is home to the past president. As a result, they chose Maine for their wedding ceremony so that they could spend meaningful time with their family. Despite the rush, the newlyweds are overjoyed to tie the knot. They stated that they were ready to marry and that they had chosen the ideal time to do so. The pair was photographed in New York City four days after their wedding, a day before a reception held by their relatives and friends in their honor. For the first time since their wedding, the pair was seen smiling and holding hands as they went around Manhattan.</p><h2>Affairs and Body Features</h2><p>Craig Coyne is a husband and father.
