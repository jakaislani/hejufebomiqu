For much of the late 1960s, hearsay about the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/how-the-beatles-formed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beatles class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Beatles</a> had been building up until the strange meme hit newspapers everywhere: that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/paul-mccartney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul McCartney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul McCartney</a> fatally crashed his Aston Martin in 1966 and for years had been replaced by an impostor. Conspiracists based their claim on a car accident report involving one of McCartney’s cars. They also note years’ worth of clues found in song lyrics and on album covers ranging from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to the Magic Mystery Tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The speculation over McCartney’s demise was at an all-time high when the band’s Abbey Road album cover was later released in September 1969. For many, the cover may simply show the band harmlessly walking across London’s Abbey Road, but for some Beatlemaniacs, the imagery was a kooky dissertation in morbid symbolism. Was it a grand conspiracy or an elaborate marketing scheme? Here are eight symbols pointed out over the years in no particular order of truthiness:</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">It’s a funeral procession</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That’s what theorists likened to the photo of the band crossing the North London Street. They point out that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/john-lennon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Lennon’s" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Lennon’s</a> white suit symbolized the color of mourning in some Eastern religions while <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ringo-starr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ringo Starr" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ringo Starr</a> is donned the more traditional black. What they neglect to point out, however, is that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/george-harrison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Harrison" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Harrison</a> is wearing denim — the color of mourning in Canada.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">McCartney's cigarette in his non-dominant hand</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Paul held his cigarette in his right hand, even though he is a lefty.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">McCartney’s feet are bare</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Why? It’s a reminder, theorists say, that in some cultures the dead are buried without their shoes.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The license plate</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the background we see a Volkswagen Beetle with the plate "LMW 28IF" Conspiracists claim this to mean that McCartney would be 28 if he were alive. (Nevermind the fact that he would actually have been 27 if the rumor were true.)</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The police van</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Parked on the side of the road is a black police van, which is said to symbolize authorities who kept silent about McCartney's fatal fender-bender.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The girl in the blue dress</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the night of McCartney’s supposed car accident, he was believed to have been driving with a fan named Rita. Theorists say the girl in the dress featured on the back cover was meant to be her, fleeing from the car crash.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Connect the dots</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also on the back cover are a series of dots. Join some of them together and you can make the number three — the number of surviving Beatles.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Broken Beatles sign</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the back cover, we see the band’s name written in tiles on a wall and there’s a crack running through it. Of all the symbols, this one turned out to be the most meaningful, and sad. Although the release of Abbey Road was followed with ample evidence that McCartney was alive and well, what the public didn’t know was that the Beatles had secretly broken up. Abbey Road would be the band’s penultimate studio album, and the group would call it quits only a year later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJomZ6ZpKGytHnAm5mesV2nvKKwjJqjm62dYrCwwsSrZJqmnp7Dpr7Smqmy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
