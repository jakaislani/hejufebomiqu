It’s great on salads—duh—but it also works as a <a href=#>marinade for meat</a>, lubrication for a tangy pasta salad, or as the dressing on an Italian sub. Italian dressing adds tangy, herby luxury to anything you drench with it, and that’s why we love it.&nbsp;</p><p>Salad dressing is all about the proper ratio of ingredients, so we looked for that perfect balance in the Italian dressings we tasted. We want tang, richness, herbs, and seasoning—and that goes for low fat Italian dressing, too. Over the course of two separate taste tests, we tried more than two dozen Italian dressings to find the best tasting Italian dressing at the grocery store. Marinate on this for a minute.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best gluten free italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Dairy Free</p><strong>Yo Mama’s Creamy Italian Dressing & Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Yo Mama’s Creamy Italian is absolutely stacked with herbs, so much so that it’s almost chunky. Most creamy Italian dressings typically involve some sort of dairy (usually parmesan cheese), but not this one. Yo Mama is gluten free, sugar free, and dairy free, but it tastes really fresh and cheesy all the same. You might think it has too many herbs, which I would understand, but if you want a fragrant, herbaceous Italian dressing that’ll last in the refrigerator, this will do just fine. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Comforting</p><strong>Marzetti Italian Salad Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Marzetti makes one of the best Italian dressings if you like it sweet. When Italian dressing isn’t sweet at all, I think you could better categorize it as a vinaigrette. Italian dressing is an American construct, and Marzetti fully leans into that. The ingredients include high fructose corn syrup, garlic, onion, bell pepper, and soybean oil. Overall, the flavor is comforting and good. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Regional</p><strong>Zia’s Sweet Italian Oil & Vinegar</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>I’ve often been critical of food in St. Louis (see: Imo’s pizza, provel cheese, etc.), but I really love this Italian dressing, which hails from the Lou. It’s made with red wine vinegar, cane sugar, and olive oil, which gives it a nice, rich flavor. There’s something super comforting about a sweet Italian dressing. Maybe I’ll go to Zia’s one day, because this Italian dressing really won me over. The only downside is you’ll probably have to buy it online, unless you live in the Midwest and they sell it near you. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best creamy italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Creamy</p><strong>Ken’s Steak House Creamy Italian Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Creamy Italian fans rise up! Ken’s Creamy Italian has a dynamic creamy and tangy quality that makes it the best creamy Italian dressing we tried, plus it’s loaded with herbs and seasoning. Personally, I like mixing <a href=#>ranch</a> and Italian dressing together to create an Italian dressing that is actually creamy, but this one is pretty dang good. It could use some cheese, but hey, just add some <a href=#>Romano cheese</a> to your salad to achieve that. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="olive garden italian dressing review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Low Fat</p><strong>Olive Garden Light Italian Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I didn’t taste this light version of Olive Garden’s signature salad dressing head to head with the full-fat version. But my colleague Jordan Myrick and I agree: If you aren’t tasting them head to head (why would you be?), you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the two. Much like the Olive Garden Italian dressing you know and love and dunk those oily little breadsticks into, this low-fat Italian dressing is salty, tangy, and a touch nutty from the bits of Romano cheese you’ll find suspended in the opaque liquid. In each two tablespoon serving, there’s only 30 calories and 2 grams of fat, while the original Olive Garden Italian has 80 calories and 8 grams of fat. If you’re looking for a low sugar or low carb Italian dressing, this works, too—there’s only 2 grams of sugar per serving. If you like Olive Garden Italian, you should totally give this a try. —Gwynedd Stuart</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="olive garden italian dressing review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Restaurant</p><strong>Olive Garden Signature Italian Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>There’s no lemon listed in this Italian dressing’s ingredients, but it’s citrusy all the same. That’s probably just a good helping of white vinegar and maybe some garlic. There’s a sweetness present here (high fructose corn syrup), and the only knock on the flavor is that it could use some herbs. A great thing about Olive Garden’s dressing is that it’s really viscous and homogenous; the oil isn’t separated at all, so you don’t need to shake the bottle. This dressing is thick and creamy and the tang is sensational. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lite italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Lite</p><strong>Ken’s Steak House Lite Northern Italian with Basil & Romano</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>If you like an Italian dressing with a lot of stuff in it (Italian dressing is just better with a lot of stuff in it) and you’re watching your fat and cals, this is the best Italian dressing you can buy. It has 60% less fat and 55% fewer calories than “regular dressing.” I’m not willing to do the math, but I assume “regular dressing” means Ken’s Italian dressing you’ll read about in the next entry. Either way, the stats are pretty good: 50 calories and 4.5 grams of fat per two tablespoon serving. You’re probably curious about that “stuff” I mentioned earlier, huh? Well, this dressing is positively packed with herbs and cheese, as well as little bits of peppers and garlic. It’s also quite oily, but I think that’s one of its best qualities considering it’s low cal. You have to shake this well and constantly, but it’s worth it if you want the best light Italian dressing. —Gwynedd Stuart</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Marinade</p><strong>Ken’s Steak House Italian with Aged Romano Dressing</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This dressing is herby, funky, cheesy, and delicious. The Romano cheese adds a really good salty bite. There’s a sharpness and a complete lack of sweetness that I found quite refreshing. This one labels itself as a marinade, too, and it’s definitely the best Italian dressing for soaking some chicken breasts. This dressing is what I think of when I picture Italian dressing. You could do much, much worse than Ken’s. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best garlicky italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RANKING-UPDATE_ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Garlicky</p><strong>Whole Foods Market Organic Italian Romano Vinaigrette</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Whole Foods Romano Italian dressing is sharp, savory, and garlicky. It’s got the most garlic flavor of any dressing on this list. It’s really robust because it’s made with olive oil (which also means it’ll congeal in the fridge), and overall just has a wonderfully complex flavor. The combo of garlic, cheese, more garlic, vinegar, and <a href=#>good olive oil</a> makes for a phenomenal dressing.

Girard’s has MSG in it, so it’s really savory. The ingredients include mustard seed, corn cider vinegar (a mixture of corn vinegar made from corn sugar and apple cider vinegar), and white wine vinegar, which make it stand out among the other Italian dressings on this list and certainly makes it among the best tasting Italian dressing on the market. It’s just got everything we want: richness, umami, piquancy, and bite. Maybe it could use some herbs or a little cheese, but it’s also fine as is. Girard’s may not be a traditional Italian dressing, but it brings flavor in a big way. Make sure to shake it often (the oil separates), but it’s definitely worth buying. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best italian dressing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST-ITALIAN-DRESSING_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Organic Italian Dressing with Romano Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Trader Joe’s</a><p>This is a prime example of perfect salad dressing alchemy. Trader Joe’s Organic Italian dressing has great acidity, good oil-based richness, and a healthy amount of herbage (a tasty trio of rosemary extract, basil, and oregano). Additionally, the salty and pungent bite of the Romano cheese elevates this Italian dressing to elite status. There’s a hint of sweetness here too, probably from the bell pepper. Trader Joe’s makes the best Italian dressing—probably better than what you could make at home. —Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Newman’s Own Family Recipe Italian, Wishbone Creamy Italian, Kroger Zesty Italian, Kraft Deluxe Supreme Italian, Kraft Zesty Italian, Walden Farms Italian, Signature Select, Simple Truth, 365 Italian, Drew’s, June Moon Spice Company, Great Value Light Zesty Italian, Great Value Fat Free Italian, Wishbone Fat Free Italian, Skinny Girl Sugar Free Italian, G Hughes Sugar Free Italian, Kraft Fat Free Zesty Italian, Newman’s Own Light Italian</p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFutdOao6KZnmKxs7HSrKCnn18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
