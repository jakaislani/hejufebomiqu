It is finally happening. Old El Paso, king of all things store-bought and taco-related is finally giving us the collab taco accessory of our dreams: dessert taco shells. Frankly, this product should have existed a long time ago. In fact, it was specifically requested by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@theimpulsivebuy</a> as a replacement for the now defunct Choco Taco in an article <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back in May 2023</a> with the title “TAKE MY IDEA.” Not all heroes wear capes but some do have food blogs, and we are ever so grateful to all parties involved because now we get to have Cinnamon Toast Crunch Dessert Taco Shells from Old El Paso in just one short month.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What do we know so far about these Cinnamon Toast Crunch taco shells? And how have we lived without them this long?</h2><p>Well, let’s taco ‘bout it. By the looks of these things, they are not made of the classic, airy,Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal material we are so used to when we buy it in the box. Instead, they are corn-based, Old El Paso Stand ‘n Stuff (aka, flat bottomed), hard taco shells that are “blasted with Cinnadust™”—the phrase General Mills uses to describe any item they’ve covered with cinnamon sugar and Cinnamon Toast Crunch branding. And let me tell you, I am not mad at this development. Yes, a dessert taco shell made entirely from Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal would be epic, but I think the corn base of these shells will add a layer of crispness, fried flavor, and umami that will elevate any dessert taco filling. The packaging, as pictured on the food news Instagram page <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@candyhunting</a>, shows what looks to be <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-vanilla-ice-cream/>vanilla ice cream</a> and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-caramel-sauce/>caramel sauce</a> served in these Cinnamon Toast Crunch taco shells, which sounds great, but I would take it one step further: dessert chilaquiles. Smash up some of these shells, use ice cream as the eggs (hey, ice cream is basically frozen eggs and things…not a stretch at all), caramel instead of salsa, and hot fudge instead of hot sauce. Okay, in truth what I’m describing is pretty much just a sundae, but if you call it “sweet chilaquiles” then you can eat it as an adult at brunchtime without judgement, and that there is a win.</p><p>These taco shells are set to hit shelves in March, and I am so ready for Old El Paso to put the T back in CTC…T for taco of course. “Toast” is so 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJuZo7uiuc6nZK2nkajBbq%2FRrqWcoF2prqS7jKyfnqScqHqlsdKsnKusXamupLuMrJ%2BepJyoeq%2Bx1qxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
