How did <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel</a> fumble one of its most treasured titles? Who will replace <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Majors</a> as the Universe’s new big bad, if at all? And, perhaps most pressingly, why didn’t we see more of M.O.D.O.K’s helmet in the film?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>For those who need a refresher, <strong><a href=#>M.O.D.O.K</a></strong> is a Marvel villain who first appeared in the original comics in 1967. More recently, the baby-faced organism made his screen debut in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a>’s 2021 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eponymous animation</a>, before taking on live-action form in this year’s Ant-Man threequel, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Corey Stoll</a> taking the reins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-modok-1.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>The character was about as divisive as Quantamania itself, with some lauding M.O.D.O.K’s humour and others finding his appearance more than a little bit unsettling. Speaking on the latter point, fans have flocked to Reddit to lament the fact that, because of his unpleasant face, M.O.D.O.K didn’t spend more time in his helmet.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>“They should’ve just left M.O.D.O.K with the helmet and scary voice,” a post by Redditor @gbcolor2024 reads. Some users agreed that Marvel should’ve shielded the character to enhance the terror, with one suggesting the team should’ve waited a while longer to reveal his real face to “make him more menacing throughout the film.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>They should’ve just left MODOK with the helmet and scary voice</a><br>by<a href=#>u/gbcolor2024</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Echoing these arguments, others agreed that the CGI head beneath M.O.D.O.K’s mask “sucked,” with some adding that the character was much more richly explored and visualised in the original comics. Some fans did come to the giant head’s defence, however, arguing that M.O.D.O.K had always been “goofy” by nature, so the comical reveal of his face was appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>“Some characters aren’t supposed to be intimidating or scary,” one Redditor wrote, “and M.O.D.O.K is absolute ‘Exhibit A’ of this fact.” Others agreed that the reveal of Darren “was hilarious,” and aligned with Ant-Man’s more comedic tendencies. “Making a joke out of him was the right call,” another fan added.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=false>In any case, it’s up to the individual viewer to decide whether M.O.D.O.K’s face was worthy of screen time because after all, beauty (or in this case ugliness) is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKimpJ3AbrjArZyrZZaWu7R5wKucZq%2BZqLWqusZmq6Gdopp6uK3SZqSoqpVivKd5zKibqKOjYrWmuMyeq2ahnmKur8CMppinZWNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
