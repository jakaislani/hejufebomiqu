Gonzo, but not exactly good.</p><p data-children-count=0>And now there’s “The Aspern Papers,” which takes the possibly even more eccentric tack of playing a story about literary legacies and lost loves as if it’s “Interview With A Vampire” and sometimes even a Hammer horror film.</p><p data-children-count=0>Directed by Julian Landais, an actor and onetime model, the movie doesn’t lack for lush appearances. The story is set in Venice, and begins with the evocation of the 19th-centuy poet Jeffrey Aspern, who is seen, Shelley-like, washing up dead on an immaculately-kept shore and being burned as his young lover clutches a folded sheaf of letters to her bosom. The aforementioned papers, you see. Years later, the American protagonist and narrator, Morton Vint, worms his way into the Venice villa occupied by the aged Julianna Bourdereau (<a href=#>Vanessa Redgrave</a>) and her middle-aged unwed niece Tina (<a href=#>Joely Richardson</a>, Ms. Redgrave’s real-life daughter). Julianna is the now-elderly possessor of those papers. Now a recluse, she is not inclined to share these documents, particularly with nosy literary types.</p><p data-children-count=0>Although he’s playing a man of letters, <a href=#>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers</a> swans around the film’s settings with a pout that suggests that he’s waiting for his cue to sing “Please allow me to introduce myself.” He offers his services as a gardener to the lonely ladies, while agreeing to pay an inordinately high rent for his quarters. Why this strategy is supposed to work with respect to getting his hands on those letters isn’t given much consideration here. Casting the movie as a sort of battle of wills between Julianna and Morton, and allowing both Rhys-Meyers and Redgrave to glare at each other and apply ripely melodramatic readings to dialogue that does, in large part, derive from the original, the movie gives short shrift to Tina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkai9pr7NZqeaqJWnwG5%2Bj2pw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
