He is recognized as one of the best rappers of all time, with roots in East Coast hip hop. Jones, the son of jazz musician Olu Dara, began his musical career in 1989 under the alias “Nasty Nas” and made demos for Large Professor. He was later featured on the Main Source song “Live at the Barbeque” in 1991.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Nas?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Nas</a> birthed as Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones was born on September 14, 1973, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City to African American parents. Olu Dara (born Charles Jones III) is a Mississippi-based jazz and blues artist. Fannie Ann (1941-2002) worked for the United States Postal Service in North Carolina. Jabari Fret, his brother, raps as Jungle and is a member of the hip-hop group Bravehearts. His father took the Yoruba name “Olu Dara” for himself. “Nasir” means “helper and protector” in Arabic, while “bin” means “son of” in Arabic. He is the cousin of Yara Shahidi and Sayeed Shahidi, both actors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Nas have?</h2><p>Nas owns a plethora of luxury artifacts, including Rolex watches, million-dollar homes, and exotic cars such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom and a Mercedes-Benz Maybach 62S. His automotive collection has a large fan base among the country’s youth.</p><p>Nas is a well-known international rapper who owns 143 automobiles in his many garages and has a monthly search volume of over 14500. He owns a multi-story home with an eight-car garage. His cars can also be seen in his music videos, such as “Ultra Black” from last year. We put together a 5-car list for this 49-year-old artist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What investments does Nas have?</h2><p>Nas has maintained a deep interest in and understanding of developing technology over the years. He is a co-founder of QueensBridge Venture Partners, a venture capital business. QueensBridge has made dozens of investments throughout the years, some of which have skyrocketed in value. The firm’s investments typically range from $100,000 to $500,000.</p><p>Every month, the fund receives over 100 proposals from new startups seeking money. Dropbox, Lyft, SeatGeek, General Assembly, Robinhood, Casper, Pill Pack, Pluto TV, Coinbase, and Genius are among QueensBridge’s most successful investments. When Amazon bought Ring for $1.1 billion in 2018, QueensBridge held a tiny stake in it. Amazon paid QueensBridge $40 million for his shares in Ring and Pill Pack.</p><p>Viacom paid $340 million for Pluto TV in 2019. QueensBridge participated in Coinbase’s 2013 Series B round, which raised $25 million at a valuation of $143 million. QueensBridge’s investment was worth between $35 million and $100 million when Coinbase went public in April 2021. Hopefully, Nas sold his Coinbase shares within the first year after the IPO, because the company’s price had dropped to roughly $13 billion by May 2022.</p><p>Nas is also a partner in the Sweet Chick chicken and waffle business. John Seymour opened the first site in 2013. The instant Nas walked into a Sweet Chick, he knew he wanted to be a part of the southern restaurant with a hip-hop twist. Sweet Chick has locations in New York, including Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Los Angeles and London.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals does Nas have?</h2><p>Nas made a lot of money via touring, streaming, and a Hennessey endorsement, but not quite as much as some people believed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Philanthropy works has Nas supported?</h2><p>Nas has supported the following charities listed below:</p><ul><li>Chris Webber Foundation</li><li>Common Ground Foundation</li><li>Save The Music Foundation</li><li>UNICEF</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqeYrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
