People also seem to like African safaris. I’ve been on three this year alone! What if we&nbsp;blended those two things together?”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>And then a studio executive shrugged his shoulders and lit his cigar with a $100 bill, which is the same thing as a green light when it comes to an Adam Sandler film.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false><i>Blended</i> is directed by Frank Coraci, who previously directed Sandler and Barrymore in&nbsp;The Wedding Singer. That seems rather promising until you get further down his curriculum vitae and notice that he also directed Sandler in&nbsp;Click, which is so titled because that is what you would do if you ever accidentally came across that movie on cable.&nbsp;Click.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Just to give you a little bit of hope about the film’s quality that will later be crushed mercilessly and leave you broken and crying in the gutter,&nbsp;Blended will also star some actors you probably wouldn’t mind seeing in a movie. There’s Joel McHale of&nbsp;Community and&nbsp;The Soup and&nbsp;Terry Crews of&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine Nine, and let’s face it, they’re both going to go to waste here.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Look, let’s not mince words: Adam Sandler has been in some pretty abysmal movies in the last few years. Yeah, he was good in&nbsp;Funny People, but that was directed by Judd Apatow, who managed to even make Katherine Heigl&nbsp;seem moderately funny. Frank Coraci, in case you didn’t read it two paragraphs ago, directed&nbsp;Click.</p><p data-characters=6 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Click.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>But if you didn’t learn your lesson from&nbsp;Grown Ups&nbsp;or&nbsp;Jack and Jill or&nbsp;That’s My Boy or&nbsp;Grown Ups 2, then you’re probably never going to learn. Go ahead and watch the trailer for&nbsp;<strong>Blended</strong> below. The movie’s coming out on May 23, 2014 and unfortunately, it will probably make a lot of money.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomaWdnpmypXnTq5iipJWneqKwwKZkrJmembmmvoydqZ6vXZeus77YpqarnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
