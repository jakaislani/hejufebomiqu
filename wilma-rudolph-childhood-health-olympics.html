My mother told me I would. I believed my mother,” she wrote in her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/50-stunning-olympic-moments-wilma-rudolph data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=autobiography class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">autobiography</a> Wilma: The Story of Wilma Rudolph.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While she knew that the brace was important to her recovery, she also admitted that she would often try to take it off. “When you come from a large wonderful family, there’s always a way to achieve your goals, especially when you don’t want your parents knowing them,” she wrote in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chicago Tribune" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chicago Tribune</a>. “I would take off my braces, then station my brothers and sisters all through the house and they would tell me if my parents were coming and then I’d hurry and put the braces back on.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For four or five years, Rudolph hid her secret from her parents, citing her Southern Baptist background for instilling guilt in her for breaking the rules. “But one day I said to my doctor: ‘I want to show you something,’” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To both her doctor and mother’s surprise, she walked across the floor, without the brace.</p><img alt="Wilma Rudolph Olympics" title="Wilma Rudolph Olympics" width=2842 height=2150 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-517322826.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Bettmann/Contributor/Getty Images</span><p>Wilma Rudolph crossing the finish line to win the women’s 400-meter relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A basketball coach laughed at her for wanting to join the team</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With both legs free, it was like Rudolph was making up for lost time. When she was 12, she loved challenging the neighborhood boys in running and jumping. “I could beat most of them and the ones that I couldn’t beat, I had plenty of brothers who would take care of that for me,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wrote class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it was at that time that she realized how ingrained in her spirit it was to prove her greatness. “I wanted to show that there was something special inside me,” she continued. “Everybody is special. You just have to realize it within yourself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Setting her sights on basketball, she would arrive early at the gym to try to catch the coach’s eye. With no luck, she decided to talk to him, rehearsing exactly what she was going to say. But when the time came, all she could blurt out was “If you will give me 10 minutes of your time, I will make you a world-class athlete.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her words were met with hysterics. “I’ll never forget how he laughed,” Rudolph wrote. But he did give her a chance to show him that she could keep up with the rest of the team. Despite that special attention, he still didn’t choose her for the team.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Her dad convinced the coach to let her on the team</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One day, she found the coach at her home, speaking to her father. “I couldn’t enter the room because I hadn’t been invited, so I ended up standing behind the door listening to an adult conversation,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=admitted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">admitted</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As it turned out, the coach wanted her older sister Yvonne on the team, thinking she could be a true star. “My father never uttered a sound,” Rudolph remembered, as he continued rocking in his rocking chair. “[Then] my father stopped rocking in his chair and he said, ‘If Yvonne is on the basketball team, then Wilma is on your basketball team also.’’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thanks to her father, she was finally officially part of a sports team. “My father had a very deep insight into the things that I wanted to accomplish as a little girl,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Playing ball trained her mind to set her sights on her goals, even if she wasn’t always the best on the team. But one day, the coach asked if anyone wanted to try out for the girls’ track team and instinctively, Rudolph knew she had found her calling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Before I realized anything, I had challenged most of the girls in my high school,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=remembered class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">remembered</a>. “Then I discovered I could beat all of the girls on the track team. Then I discovered I could beat all the girls in my high school.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The more people she beat, the more attention she got, eventually capturing the eyes of a coach at Tennessee State University, even though she was still a high school student.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But she started training with the college students. “I don't know why I run so fast — I just run,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016444.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said data-vars-ga-product-id=de811b88-b647-4b97-9352-2cabdb99a148 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016444.html data-product-url=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016444.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fsportscentury%2Ffeatures%2F00016444.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4dde07ac-45c9-4af3-a0fc-ec57bdac7783 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">said</a>. Though she didn’t know where it was taking her, she just kept running. “Coming from this small southern town, I didn’t even know what the word Olympics meant,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=recalled class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">recalled</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rudolph won her first Olympic medal at 16</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon her speed and determination sent her to the global stage, where she won a bronze medal at the Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when she was just 16 — giving her serious bragging rights at school, where she was welcomed back as a champion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But when her classmates passed around her medal, it gave her a newfound goal. “When I got it back, there were handprints all over it,” she wrote in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-08-8902230553-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chicago Tribune" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chicago Tribune</a>. “I took it and I started shining it up — I discovered that bronze doesn’t shine. So, I decided I’m going to try this one more time. I’m going to go for the gold.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she did with all her other goals, four years later, Rudolph was back on the Olympic stage, still as a teenager. And she didn’t just bring back the one gold medal she promised herself, but set a record with a trio of golds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Running nine races in eight days, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://tokyo2020.org/en/news/wilma-rudolpha-the-trio-of-golds data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="clocked in 11.3 seconds" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">clocked in 11.3 seconds</a> in the 100-meter semi-final and 11.0 seconds in the finals (though a tailwind discounted it from being a world’s record), and then won the 200-meter in 24.0 seconds, having <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/11/12/Track-star-Wilma-Rudolph-dies/3572784616400/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="set the Olympic record" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">set the Olympic record</a> in the semi-finals with 23.2 seconds.
