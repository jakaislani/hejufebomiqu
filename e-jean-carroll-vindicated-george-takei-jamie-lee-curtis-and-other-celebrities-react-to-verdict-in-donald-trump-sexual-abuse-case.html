He previously said on his Truth Social account that the town hall “could turn into a disaster for all, including me,” and that’s never been more true in light of his battery and defamation case against Carroll.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>Trump’s sexual abuse and defamation case with Carroll is a civil suit and not criminal. His loss is just one example of the legal woes that continue to befall the former president. His arraignment in April in the Stormy Daniels hush money case resulted in him being charged with 34 counts of criminal tax fraud. That <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">indictment</a> will see the next stage of its development on Dec. 4, when Trump is scheduled to report for an in-person hearing. Not to mention he is still facing the wrath of Attorney General Letitia James’ civil lawsuit against him.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>In October of 2022, the former president called Carroll’s sexual abuse claims “a complete con job,” a “lie,” and “a hoax.” Today, in response to the Manhattan jury’s ruling, he said on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Truth Social account</a>, “I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO THIS WOMAN IS. THIS VERDICT IS A DISGRACE – A CONTINUATION OF THE GREATEST WITCH HUNT OF ALL TIME!”</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=false>Carroll is to be awarded $5 million from Trump in punitive and compensatory damages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SybrbEmqVmm5Gnv7C4y2atoqaUnrCiwMSdZKCdn6e0pnnTmqKeoV2frq61xGajnp1dmMKzwMisZJqmlGK8tbTEq2ScnZyar7O106KcrGWimq6kwIytpmaulaexqq%2FTZqCnZZSku6K4w2arq62dpXq0sdeumKVlkZfCtLGMnJisnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
