A zombie outbreak that happened a while ago that caused millions to die has since been contained, thanks to a miracle of modern medicine. If caught in time, those bitten can receive a daily shot to stave off their transformation into snarling blood-thirsty fiends. These beings who find themselves in this human-zombie limbo are known as the Returned and not everyone is happy about their presence.</p><p>Exemplifying this new normal is Toronto couple Kate (<a href=#>Emily Hampshire</a>, a near-ringer for <a href=#>Parker Posey</a>) and Alex (<a href=#>Kris Holden-Ried</a>, a near-ringer for musician Richard Thompson).

Some want to quarantine these stigmatized survivors, while others stage protests against their very existence.</p><p>As matters worsen and violence breaks out as the stock continues to dwindle, Kate–who already was getting&nbsp; Alex’s supply under the counter–decides it’s time to they go on the run and hide out with the help of their supportive friends, who offer refuge at their remote chalet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55loprBtr7NnptmamBmgQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
