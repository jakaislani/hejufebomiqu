Magazine. The king has a rescheduled official visit to France on September 20, so [he] has a few days to spare in London to meet with his son. Staff are trying to fine-tune the details as we speak.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Post also noted that Harry’s wife, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/meghan-markle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meghan Markle" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Meghan Markle</a>, is not expected to join the conversation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Naturally, none of this is set in stone. The rag’s own Sussex sources have denied that any such plans are being made, and no official statement from the king or Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has been made. But it’s easy to imagine that, with all of the affairs King Charles has been recently trying to get in order, reconciling with his prodigal son has to be on his list.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a0a518c7-4b7c-4fec-af85-d82b1326dcac_1638207313.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Michael Natale" title="Headshot of Michael Natale" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Michael Natale is the news editor for <a href=#>Best Products</a>, covering a wide range of topics like gifting, lifestyle, pop culture, and more.
