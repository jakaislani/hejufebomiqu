We know, of course, that all four of Bruce Wayne’s protégés – Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing and Red Hood – will be playable in the spiritual successor to Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy (similar gameplay, different continuity), but not much else besides that.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>As an open world title, players will be able to explore Gotham City to its fullest as any member of the quartet either solo or in co-op, with the ultimate goal being to bring some semblance of peace and safety to the streets of Batman’s old stomping ground following his apparent death. This will involve, among other things, wiping out street-level criminals who owe their allegiance to iconic members of the Caped Crusader’s rogues’ gallery, though which and how many of these will be present in the final game remains a topic ripe for debate.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>As of writing, only Mr. Freeze has been confirmed as a shoo-in, though thanks to some new concept art released earlier this week by the studio, we may now know of a second.

Pamela is the real first name of infamous villain Poison Ivy, and its use here, especially in green, is almost certainly no coincidence.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>What remains to be seen, however, is whether this reference is alluding to Ivy having a role in the game or if it’s simply a tribute to her character. We’re leaning towards the former, but what do you think?
