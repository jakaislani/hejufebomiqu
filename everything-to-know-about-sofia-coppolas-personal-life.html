Coppola's spectacular work has been a widely celebrated creation for around five decades, which has catapulted her to become one of the most decorated female directors. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on May 14, 1971, in New York City, to legendary filmmakers <strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong>, and <strong>Eleanor Coppola,</strong> one doesn't need to look far when gauging the source of Coppola's genius in the field. Coppola kick-started her journey as an actress but carved a more illustrious career as a director. Coppola's second feature, <i>Lost in Translation,</i> won her one Oscar out of the three nominations. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Sofia Coppola Married to? &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Sofia's exceptional features and her career at large are often in the spotlight but the filmmaker's personal life always falls under the radar. The <i>Lost in Translation</i> actress has been long married to musician <strong>Thomas Mars</strong>, with whom she shares two kids. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/27/186704443_205950964694974_4221772657648090698_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698407851395.jpg><p>Coppola's husband, Mars, 46, whose real name is Thomas Pablo Croquet,&nbsp;is a French singer and the frontman of the French band, Phoenix. Thomas's well-known indie-pop has released seven studio albums and won a Grammy for <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.</i></p><p>The pair's low-key nuptial recently shot to headlines after Mars jumped in to support his wife. Coppola wasn't granted permission to use Elvis's music in her soon-to-be-releasing biopic when Thomas, and his band, Phoenix, took the responsibility of writing the score. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/27/380434051_877895973756117_7682873072036061679_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698407817210.jpg><p>Defying the old-fashioned norm of keeping one's professional life separate from personal life, Sofia's husband said, "I know they say it shouldn't be done, but what do I know, it happened naturally." Coppola was a married woman when she met Mars sets of Coppola's 1999 mega-hit, <i>The Virgin Suicides. </i>Coppola and Mars continued their collegial ties, with Mars contributing soundtracks for her films.&nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Bling Ring</i> director would eventually call it quits with her first husband, director <strong>Spike Jonze</strong>, and delve into another high-profile romance. Thomas worked on a number of Coppola's projects, including Somewhere, <i>The Bling Ring, </i>and <i>The Beguiled,</i> before starting a romantic relationship with her. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sofia's older daughter, Romy, went viral after she tried to charter a helicopter! &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The private couple walked <a href=#>down the aisle</a> in Bernalda, Italy, which happens to be the birthplace of Sofia's great-grandfather, on August 27, 2011. The twosome has since welcomed two daughters, one of whom recently went viral on social media platforms. Sofia gave birth to their firstborn, <strong>Romy Mars</strong>, in November 2006. &nbsp;</p><p>Romy, a 17-year-old aspiring model, went viral for all the wrong reasons after she tried to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland. Romy's naive and unpleasant disposition shortly landed her the title of internet's favorite nepotism-baby and also landed her otherwise low-key parents into hot waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/27/340322436_5880948985361523_2467711156643392878_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698407825414.jpg><p>In a since-deleted clip, Romy quippingly laments about having busy parents, saying her parents are "never home." She then proceeds to call her babysitter her "replacement parents." Sofia and Thomas also share a 13-year-old daughter, <strong>Cosima Mars,</strong> who is also being kept out of the spotlight. "I don't want them ever to be jaded," Coppola once explained, adding, "I just want them to have a childhood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Sofia Coppola's Past Romances! &nbsp;</h3><p>Coppola currently doesn't have the most high-profile relationship, but there was a time when the Oscar winner's personal life was often the subject of intense tabloid scrutiny. Given her prominent background and her unparalleled talent, Coppola didn't have a problem landing a man as exceptional as her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/27/179569161_2242739112525658_578380316373885026_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698407865184.jpg><p>The <i>Lost in Translation</i> director was still dabbling in acting when she had a brief romance with actor<strong> Keanu Reeves</strong>. The pair's short-lived love reportedly fizzled right before Coppola entered a high-profile relationship with fellow Oscar-winning filmmaker, <strong>Spike Jonze,</strong> on the sets of a music video. The pair went from being colleagues to friends, before eventually tying the knot in 1999. &nbsp;</p><p>Coppola and Jonze got married on June 26, 1999, at Sofia's father's winery in Napa Valley, California. Throughout their fleeting marriage, the couple worked on a few projects, gushingly supported each other's work, and eventually saw their relationship unraveled. There've been several speculations about the duo's split since then. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/10/27/379503008_585094486981606_4089379606733309675_n%20(1)%20(1)-1698407840817.jpg><p>Sofia and Jonze's masterpieces, Sofia's <i>Lost in Translation</i>, and Jonze's <i>Her</i>, both released around the same time in 2013, seemed to be telling the same story, of the spouses' colliding experiences despite being in the same home, and business. &nbsp;</p><p>Coppola later seemingly confirmed the movie's connection with her own marriage, and<a href=#> said</a>, "It wasn't really the right life for me to be with him, and what he wanted in his life." The Oscar-winning filmmakers finalized their divorce after four years of marriage in 2003. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6tnqqpqbWqusZmq6hlm6O8uHnAm6aurF2ovKe1wGaaqKigpLmiv4ypnKurn6OurXnLop2e</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
