He’s actually injured,” the deputy explained. “Please leave.”</p><p>Gelin continued recording and questioning Gallardo.</p><p>“I’m watching,” Gelin said. “I want to make sure he’s getting taken care of.”</p><p>Gelin said in a recent news release that the incident started when a fight broke out between two homeless men and Gelin helped break up the fight.</p><p>“Before we could get there, one man was hit in the head with a bottle and he fell to the ground bleeding,” Gelin said in the release. “One man was trying to stop the bleeding and already helping.</p><p>“I took out my phone to record, thinking that if he died at least his family could see that he was cared for in his last moments.”</p><p>When two deputies on the scene arrived, they explained why they could not render aid and told people yelling for them to call an ambulance that one had already been called, according to Gelin’s news release.</p><p>He said both deputies saw him recording and did not say anything to him. Gallardo was the third deputy to arrive, Gelin said.</p><p>His footage showed how his conversation with Gallardo escalated.</p><p>“What’s the rule? Is there a rule about that?” Gelin asked.</p><p>“We don’t want you right here if I’m attending him,” Gallardo said.</p><p>“OK. You’re not attending him,” Gelin said. “What are you doing?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Commissioner-recording.jpg><p>“Sir, right now I’m gonna ask you again. On the other side of that hedge,” Gallardo said.</p><p>“Why? Why do I have to go to the other side?” Gelin asked.</p><p>Soon after, Gallardo told Gelin:</p><p>“You’re gonna get arrested for obstruction.”</p><p>Gelin asked how he was obstructing.</p><p>“‘Cause I’m asking you to go to the other side,” the deputy said. “I don’t want you approaching me.”</p><p>“I’m not approaching you,” Gelin said. “You approached me.”</p><p>It appeared that Gelin was stepping backward with his cellphone when he asked, “What about everybody else?”</p><p>At the time, at least one other bystander was standing near the victim.</p><p>Gelin said after the encounter that he never interfered with the police investigation or followed Gallardo.</p><p>“I was publicly humiliated, handcuffed, placed in the police car, fingerprinted, booked, and placed in jail,” Gelin said in the news release. “As a result, I have a mugshot all over the internet, as if I am a criminal.”</p><p>Gelin said despite filing a formal complaint with internal affairs, speaking to the county sheriff and other local officials, “nothing happened to the officer.”</p><p>When the commissioner noticed the deputy was being celebrated, Gelin addressed him directly Sept. 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Untitled.png><p><strong>Related:</strong> <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="A Florida Deputy Was Blindsided When a City Official Confronted Him for ‘Falsely’ Arresting Him Years Ago: ‘You’re a Bad Police Officer’ (opens in a new tab)" href=#>A Florida Deputy Was Blindsided When a City Official Confronted Him for ‘Falsely’ Arresting Him Years Ago: ‘You’re a Bad Police Officer’</a></strong></p><p>“You probably don’t remember me,” the commissioner said. “But you’re the police officer who falsely arrested me four years ago. You lied on your police report. I believe you are a rogue police officer, you’re a bad police officer and you don’t deserve to be here.”</p><p>Gelin said after the recent commission meeting the deputy offered to work with him to bring about positive change, and the commissioner agreed.</p><p>“I don’t want anyone to go through what I went through or worse,” Gelin said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e5BpZmlvX556qa3VnmSaZZ2qtLS0zq1kmqScYry3sdFmq6GdXZ67tbHRp5ytZZahvLO1w5pknKedora0v8iopZ6qXaeyrbHArJysZaaesaa7jKidZpmip7K0wIytn5qsXaGypXnTqGShoZ1isKK4y6KloGWfqsFuw8eiq55lk6S9brDUq6Cnn12WxKK%2Bw2aanqqVoryvxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
