It stars <a href=#>Kayije Kagame</a> as a novelist who is attending the trial of a woman named Laurence Coly, played by Guslagie Malanda. Coly has been accused of murdering her child, allowing it to be swept away by the tide on a beach. Based on the real trial of Fabienne Kabou, "Saint Omer" is not your typical courtroom drama, a film that works in a deeply emotional register. I found some parts of it more manipulative than my colleagues, but it's undeniably a good film, and a very welcome addition to the Criterion Collection, complete with a new interview with Diop and an awesome conversation between the filmmaker and <a href=#>Dee Rees</a>, the director of "<a href=#>Mudbound</a>".</p><p><a href=#>Buy it here</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Special Features<br>New 2K digital master, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack<br>New and archival interviews with director Alice Diop<br>Conversation between Diop and author Hélène Frappat<br>Conversation between Diop and filmmaker Dee Rees from a 2023 episode of The Director’s Cut – A DGA Podcast<br>Trailer<br>New English subtitle translation<br>PLUS: An essay by critic Jennifer Padjemi</p><p><strong>"<a href=#>The Shootist</a>" (Arrow)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/6605ed68306fcc2955b4963e/content_Shootist.jpg><p>Someone asked me the other day what my favorite Westerns were, and I started with "<a href=#>My Darling Clementine</a>," "<a href=#>Stagecoach</a>," and "<a href=#>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</a>," but it wasn't long before I mentioned "The Shootist," <a href=#>John Wayne</a>'s final film and a masterful drama that works both as its own standalone story and an elegy for both a genre and its most famous face. Wayne plays J.B. Brooks, a famous gunfighter who learns he has terminal cancer. The legendary performer is breathtakingly good here, giving one of his best performances opposite an insane supporting cast that includes <a href=#>Lauren Bacall</a>, <a href=#>John Carradine</a>, <a href=#>Harry Morgan</a>, <a href=#>James Stewart</a>, and a young <a href=#>Ron Howard</a>. The Arrow release of "The Shootist" is one of the best physical media editions so far this year. Not only does the film look better than ever with a restoration from the camera negative, but it includes physical collectibles and new interviews and video essays, including a spectacular one by our very own Scout Tafoya called "Contemplating John Wayne: The Death of a Cowboy."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqGnnZp6prrTnqmtmZmjuqa602aerqGUmnqurdGcn2ZqYGeB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
