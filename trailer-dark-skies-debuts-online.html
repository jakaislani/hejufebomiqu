What we don’t get that often is a focus on one family and how it affects them, but that’s exactly what we get with the new thriller <strong>Dark Skies</strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Today, thanks to <a href=#>First Showing</a>, we have the first trailer for the film which gives you an idea of the creepy kind of atmosphere they’re going for.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>The first comparison that most are likely to make is to another alien film that focused on a single family, Signs, a film that’s from back when M. Night Shyamalan used to make good movies. It does indeed look a little similar, though <strong>Dark Skies</strong> looks to be amping up the strange occurrences.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Just from this trailer it looks like it could be a decent film, though I have to admit, it made me burst out laughing a couple of times, which is more than likely not what they’re going for. When you have one character standing in the middle of a backyard though with their mouth wide open in a goofy manner and another randomly banging their head against a window, it’s kind of hard to resist.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>What leads me to believe that it won’t be decent is the fact that Scott Charles Stewart wrote and directed it. You may know his name from having directed Priest and Legion, two pretty terrible films. With these being his only previous feature films, it’s kind of hard to come to a positive conclusion about his latest project, though perhaps the third time will be the charm for him.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true><strong>Dark</strong><strong> Skies</strong>, which stars Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton, arrives in theaters on February 22nd, 2013.</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>Check out the trailer below and let us know if you think this will be any good in the comments.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6uZmaGys3nDmqmkZaOgtqa%2FjJ2cm62kqHqwusuipZ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
