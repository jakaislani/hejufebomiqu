Even better, options like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lavinso Foot Peel Mask</a> cost way less than a pedicure, giving you two separate applications for just $16.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">exfoliating mask</a> includes a handful of all-natural ingredients — salicylic acid, aloe, tea tree oil, citric acid, orange extract, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>malic acid</a> — that shed away dead skin to reveal baby-soft feet in as little as three days. Simply slip each foot into one of the booties for at least an hour to let the potion get to work — no scrubbing involved. In the days after, all you have to do is wait as the dead skin gradually peels away and reveals smoother-looking feet.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The treatment, which has over <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">17,200 five-star Amazon ratings</a>, is completely painless and irritation-free. Many reviewers recommend soaking your feet for 10 minutes before using the mask to see "freaky results" that are "better than going to the salon." According to one shopper, "even the most awfully calloused feet will benefit from this." In fact, people say so much dead skin came off their feet that they would advise others to wear socks during the peeling phase to keep the shedding off bed sheets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After day 8, my feet are peeling and boy oh boy, what an amazing product," wrote one user. "I was starting to think it wasn't going to happen, but patience paid off. I have been getting bi-weekly pedicures since forever, so I thought my feet were in excellent shape. But peeling away this layer of old skin was fascinating. It did not hurt at all. It peeled around my toes, the top of my toes, and the top of my foot."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the first time I've really ever had very rough, hard heels and 'old' looking feet; so bad, I didn't even want to have a pedicure or wear sandals," shared another. "These foot peels were super easy to use, and boy, are they effective. Totally painless. The new skin coming through was very soft, like new. I would totally recommend it. My sister and mother have ordered their boxes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lavinso Foot Peel Mask</a> for $16 on Amazon.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-more-foot-mask-on-amazon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop More Foot Mask on Amazon:</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2zu8Oumq2rXam8sLjSaKOarpmjwLB5xaimrWWgmrKtecyaqqRlkaKuu7vN</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
